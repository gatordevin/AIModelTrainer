User Launches Program
From here they can load a model, load a dataset, and load a folder

-----------------MODEL----------------
Users should be able to select the type of model they want U-Net vs Mask R-CNN etc
They should be able to change architecture spefic things which only affects model creation no other pipelines

-----------------DATASET----------------
Dataset should be indepedent of the select model
The dataset will only contain the paths to the images and or masks
Dont want to create folders everytime there is a new dataset because it risks deletion
Images for a single dataset can be across multiple folders and deleted
if deleted the dataset will skip over that path after running a check
Several mask storage options either in the form of a binary mask, multi color mask, or polygons
Polygons allows for instance segmentation
Binary mask allows for single class semantic segmentation
Multi color mask allows for muli class semantic segmentation
Data that is present is different images as opposed to a json of polygons
Data leaving the dataset should be consistent a single image with a multidimensional array containg all masks
All images should be RGB with the exception of masks which should all be binary

At training runtime dataset needs to have properities trained to match the model
This includes applying all transformations that will be selctable by the User
Also includes any scaling or padding that needs to be done

---------------LOAD FOLDER----------------
USer should be able to load and browse through a folder of images
Images should be processed
